How to purchase PupperCoin:

1. Within remix deploy the PupperCoinSalesDeployer contract
 - Take note of the Token_address and the Token_sale_address

2. Within remix copy the Token_sale_address (from the deployed contract) and paste into the "address" bar. Prior to selecting address, ensure the contract is updated to reflect 'PupperCoinSale.' Once the contract is updated select the address button. This will deploy your puppercoinsale contract.

3. Within remix copy the Token_address (from the deployed contract) and paste into the "address" bar. Prior to selecting address, ensure the contract is updated to reflect 'PupperCoin' Once the contract is updated select the address button. This will deploy your puppercoin contract.

4. In order to purchase PupperCoins (PPCN) you will need to expand your PupperCoinSale contract and expand the "buyTokens" field. From there, you input an address from Ganache. Above you should denote how many tokens you wish to buy. Then select the "transact" button to purchase the tokens.

Trouble with the Homework:

1. I was unable to get the fakenow function to operate correctly.
2. I was able to set-up the PPCN within MyWallet however I wasn't sure how to send transactions.
3. I was unable to generate screenshots in order to show my code working so I just saved my .sol file with my code for review.
